# Homework_Two_Bootstrap
Second homework task
* Created the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` in addition to a 'stylesheet.css'
* Used Bootstrap to develop a portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* Note - the Bootstrap portfolio does not use media queries. I could not find a way for the media queries to add value to the task.



* Note - some responsive issues experienced with index.html document. Could work out how to resolve. From screen width 991px to 576px, snow leopard image and text box clash

* Note - sticky footer works when rendering directly from VS Code. However, not showing when accessing through GitHub...styling and HTML shows it is there on GitHub however.
